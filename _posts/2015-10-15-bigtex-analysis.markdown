# Initial Inspection
Upon first loading the site, we are presented with a big of a mess. There is a lot of content that seems important, but nothing stands out against everything else, making it more of a wall of text than anything worthwhile (although I'm sure it is).

There is also a lot of images with text embedded into them. That's not good, either for SEO or the site in general.

The site feels cold and unwelcoming from its stiff use of tables and default typography. Even scrolling down from the main page, I already feel lost as it is dificult to decipher what exactly the website is trying to tell me.

It's also confused that some images are repeated and some of the text is hard to read because they are inside images. The big "Like Us on Facebook" reminds the user that this is a very web 1.0 website.

# Coding

There's a lot of cruff that isn't needed. Tons of empty DIVs, and for some reason a TON of empty \<font\> tags. I can also see many instances of inline CSS. I suspect this was used by a pagebuilder since inline CSS is HIGHLY discouraged.
