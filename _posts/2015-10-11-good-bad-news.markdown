It was at this moment that as Miek stared past the his small bundle of flickering fire that he was not alone.

A wolf had been following him. A wolf that he had sensed before earlier that evening. The wolf was smart. He kept his distance just far enough that he was faintly traced.

Normally this would cause Miek to be offensive, but there was something about this wolf that seemed distant. It was his eyes. They didn't convey the anger at seeing another Panda. He was longing.

It was raining, and cold. The wolf just wanted some warmth. Just for a little while.

The wolf stepped closer, eyes locked my Miek.

_That cape!_ thought Miek. Wrapped around the wolf's neck was the warchiefs cape. Stolen, most likely. It had to be. The wolves never had allegiance with any walking animal since the great uprising.

This wasn't just any normal wolf, he was cast. Perhaps being chased, Miek pondered. The wolf intended to return to the capitol with the warcape in chance for asylum.

Miek pulled his hat down slightly over his brow as the steady, freezing rain licked the sides of his camp.
