# Accessing The Dashboard
Step 1: Go to [http://fairportgoldexchange.com/wp-admin/](http://fairportgoldexchange.com/wp-admin/)

Step 2: Login using the correct username and password

On the left sidebar, you will see a lot of links to different parameters of the website.

For the most part, you will only be concerned with "WooCommerce" and "Products"

# Viewing All Current Products
On the left sidebar, click on the "Products" tab. This will take you to your current inventory screen.

From here, you can bulk edit items. Some of these items may already be expired due to them being exteral links to your eBay listings.

# Adding Products
Step 1: On the left sidebar, hover over the "Products" tab and select "Add Product"

Step 2: From here, you will be able to input all the products details, such as title, description, and pricing.

Step 3: Fill out as much detail as possible. Don't forget to go through all the tabs on the "Product Data" section.
Step 4: Under "Attributes," you can select the preloaded attributes from the dropdown menu, or add your own by selecting "Custom Product Attribute" and clikcing "add."

Step 5: Add your main image in the "product image" section. You can add additional images in the "product gallery images" section.

### Adding eBay Options
Step 1: Just like before, fill out all the details again for the eBay options.

Step 2: Since eBay is in a different coding language than WooCommerce, you may have to double check the created product on eBay for any errors, as well as adding any images to the eBay listing.
