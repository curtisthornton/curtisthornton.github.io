## Purpose

The purpose of this Automator app is to take the currently selected files and folders and place them into a folder titled "from design to qc."

## Known Issues

Currently, the action only copies files and folders instead of moving them altogether, meaning you have to deleted the original copies once the action is complete. I can see this as an unecessary step in the process, but it also acts as a safeguard in case you accidentally ran this action on the wrong files.
