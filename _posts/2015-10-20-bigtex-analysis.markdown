# Initial Inspection
Upon first loading the site, we are presented with a bit of a mess. There is a lot of content that seems important, but nothing stands out against everything else, making it more of a wall of text than anything worthwhile (although I'm sure it is).

There is also a lot of images with text embedded into them. That's not good, either for SEO or the site in general.

The site feels cold and unwelcoming from its stiff use of tables and default typography. Even scrolling down from the main page, I already feel lost as it is dificult to decipher what exactly the website is trying to tell me.

It's also confusing that some images are repeated and some of the text is hard to read because they are inside images. The big "Like Us on Facebook" reminds the user that this is a very web 1.0 website.

# Coding
Okay, where to start...

There is way too much coding going on the main page for what is being loaded, and that's mostly because it looks to be built by a WYSIWYG editor. There are a ton of empty \<div\> and \<font\> frames.

I am also seeing a lot of inline CSS, which is a *major* problem, since inline CSS should only be used as a last resort and as a temporary solution to a styling problem. I have no doubt that whatever program was used to build this site injected them.

Since everything was build using tables, the site is not mobile-friendly. Many elements are mis-aligned from this as well.

As we go along the pages from the tab menu, things don't get much better.

# Design
From what I can tell, Big Texas Containers doesn't really have a logo. It has sort of a logotype with just the name, but nothing that indicates any branding outside of that.

From a universal design aspect, there's nothing really holding the site contents together in any unified fashion, other than maybe the background color of the website. There are a few instances with some of the images being somewhat of the same design (image on the left, bulleted text on the right), but like I mentioned earlier, this is not good coding, design, or SEO.

# Conclusion
From what I can tell, Big Texas Containers has all the content to become a powerhouse of container-related retail. If there's one thing that many business websites don't have is content, and there's certainly enough here to go through.

To do this, the owner would need to switch from WYSIWYG website editors to a more manageable CMS dashboard. And, of course, the web designer's choice for this would be [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org).

Transferring all the content from this site to a new CMS would involve some very extensive sorting and reclassification in order to have better SEO and organization to the site. This is not something that can be completed in a short time, and is something that would need to be done as an ongoing basis.

### Branding
Big Texas Containers would need to go through some extensive rebranding to reflect the company's new website, one that is both good for print and web, and can translate easily to social media.

Along with a new logo, I would suggest a complete branding guide to include things like preferred colors and other design standards.

Some examples of a new logo are below.

### Website
My recommended Wordpress-based site would be [Space9](http://www.cssigniter.com/preview/space9) from [cssigniter](http://www.cssigniter.com/ignite/).

This theme offers some really solid design elements and can be adaoptable to almost any design changes. The theme is compatable with [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/), so you can list, sort, display, and update your inventory from the Wordpress dashboard.

# Proposal
Unfortunately, this isn't something I will be able to do as an ongoing basis, especially since my workload is already pretty heavy with a full-time job. Many of my clients are small, one-time setups with minimal upkeep, and are usually done on a freelance basis.

The type of website the owner is looking to seek for this scale would require a dedicated webmaster.

I will, however, offer my branding services that include (but are not limited to): logo design, branding guidelines, media kit, and intangeable files for print or web.

I will also work with any web designer and provide them with any media assets, as well as consultations and light assistance with coding on an as-needed basis.

The price for my rebranding service is $1,800 as a flat rate, or $35/hour (whichever is cheapest).
